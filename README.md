Building a Todo application in Go using Cobra

> Building an Awesome CLI App in Go – OSCON 2017
> A workshop written and delivered by Steve Francia and Ashley McNamara at OSCON 2017 outlining the techniques, principles, and libraries you need to create user-friendly command-line interfaces and command suites before walking you through building your own app. Along the way, you’ll cover everything from how to design and build commands to working with and parsing flags, config files and remote config systems, and how to work with environment variables and 12-factor apps. By the end of the workshop, you’ll have a working knowledge of Go and your very own functioning CLI app.
> 
> This workshop covers:
> 
> - CLI application design
> - Introduction to the Go programming language
> - Introduction to the Cobra CLI framework (used by Kubernetes, Docker, Hugo, etc)
